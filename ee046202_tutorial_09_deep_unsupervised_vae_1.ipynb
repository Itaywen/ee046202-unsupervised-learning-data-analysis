    "    * But do we really need 784 values to represent a digit? The answer is no. We belive that the data lies on a low-dimensional space which is enough to describe the observartions. In case of MNIST, we can choose to represent digits as one-hot vectors, which means we only need 10 dimensions. So we can **encode** high-dimensional observations in a low-dimensional space.\n",
    "    * But how can we learn meaningful low-deminsional representations? The general idea is to reconstruct or, **decode** the low-dimensional representation to the high-dimensional reperesentation, and use the reconstruction error to find the best representations (using the gradients of the error) . This is the core idea behind **autoencoders**."

    "* **Autoencoders** - models which take data as input and discover some latent state representation of that data.The input data is converted into an encoding vector where each dimension represents some learned attribute about the data. The most important detail to grasp here is that our encoder network is outputting a single value for each encoding dimension. The decoder network then subsequently takes these values and attempts to recreate the original input. Autoencoders have **three parts**: an encoder, a decoder, and a 'loss' function that maps one to the other. For the simplest autoencoders - the sort that compress and then reconstruct the original inputs from the compressed representation - we can think of the 'loss' as describing the amount of information lost in the process of reconstruction."

    "As you recall, in deep neural networks we use **backpropagation** of the gradients to update the weights. In the training process we need to **sample** $z$'s and forward them through the decoder, and they are sampled from $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu(X), \\Sigma(X))$. So normaly, code-wise it would look something like this: `z = torch.normal(mu_x, sigma_x)` or `z = np.normal(mu_x, sigma_x)`."
